# Gerald Challenge

Hello, everyone! I just created this repository in order to achieve an interview challenge from [Gerald](https://joingerald.com/) and [Taller](https://tallertechnologies.com/). I took some extra built-in components that I had already developed within previous applications and created some kind of template to prevent spending useful time in basic stuff. 
It's important for you to know that every single line of code that doesn't come from a node library was written by me. I've made the adjustments for it to fit new libraries versions and this particular template which is brand new; feel free to take whatever you find useful for your own purpose though.

*PS: As this is a dummy project, I'm not going to ignore environment files from the repository so it'll be easier for you to run the app.*

## Installation

First, check [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to be aware of the tools I'm assuming you already have installed. This project was built with **ReactNative Cli**, so make sure you have selected that tab in the Docs site.
In order to install the project in your computer, just run:

    yarn install

Keep in mind that I have used the following tools versions:

 - JDK: v19.0.2
 - Ruby: v2.6.10
 - Cocoapods: v1.11.3
 - NPM: v8.19.4
 - Node: v16.20.0
 - Gradle: v7.5.1

**Troubleshooting**: In case you face issues with iOS dependency installation, run the following:

    cd ios && pod install

## Usage

Once downloaded all the dependencies and checked all version listed above, you can go ahead and run the React Native project in your local device or simulator, run:
For **Development** Environment:

    yarn start:dev
For **Staging** Environment:

    yarn start:staging

And then, link your device/simulator to the Metro Builder you just started according to the OS you're willing to use, commands:
For **iOS**:

    yarn ios

For **Android**:

    yarn android

## The challenge description

Well, now I'm going to try to solve the challenge that these companies sent me. I created this section to paste down below the challenge information once I finish.
Wish me luck, folks. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
